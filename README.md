## About

I have a terrible memory and I hate fragmentation. I like to wake up and know what I have to do for the day. Agenda gathers tasks and events from [many sources](#sources) and sends them to you via email or [pushover](https://pushover.net)

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brettof86/agenda.git
cd agenda
chmod +x agenda.rb
ln -s /usr/local/bin/agenda agenda.rb
agenda help
```

## Sources

Right now these are the sources where Agenda pulls from

- Google Calendar
- MS Exchange
- ICloud Reminders
